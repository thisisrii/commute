THINGS I CAN REMEMBER DOING... NOT GOING FURTHER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO @KEENAN

- Created Babel config file
- Installed TypeScript
- Installed TypeScript Loader
- Edited Webpack to read tsx, ts, jsx and use TypeScript loader 
- Edited Webpack so that dist files build
- Created tsconfig file (lets pretend KSYS is opensource)
- Converted all files to React typescript files (JSX)
- Created models folder and interfaces
- AUTO GENERATED React Component Code in driver_detail.tsx after implementing the interface.

** You can have a look through it I don't think any of it will run. I also suggest switching to FuseBox instead of Webpack because it's much faster. The call to google maps takes awhile so most likely going to need to implement Redux or Mobex, the concept of reducers maybe -I don't know much on this- and some CSS styling to get it looking good. 

Side Note: IMO bootstrap is overkill for this, just need a simple css framework, you're never going to use
the JQUERY, JS in bootstrap...
